## Brief

Project Title: Class Schedule Website

### Objective:

We need a user-friendly website to showcase our fitness class schedule. The current method of displaying classes on a physical board at the studio is outdated, and we want to provide our clients with a digital platform for easy access to class information.

### Key Features:

1. Class Schedule:

Create a visually appealing and organized class schedule grid.
Display class names, instructors, times, and locations for each day of the week.

2. Filter and Search:

Implement a search bar for users to quickly find specific classes.
Include filters for class type (e.g., yoga, cardio, strength) and instructor.

3. Class Details:

Design individual pages for each class with detailed information, including a brief description, instructor bio, and any special requirements.

4. User Accounts:

Allow users to create accounts and log in to save their favorite classes.
Provide an option for users to receive notifications for upcoming classes they've saved.

5. Responsive Design:

Ensure the website is fully responsive for users to access the class schedule on various devices.

6. Registration:

Include a simple registration process for users to sign up for classes.
Provide confirmation emails with class details upon successful registration.

### Technical Requirements:

* Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development.
* Implement a responsive design using a CSS framework like Bootstrap.
* Use JavaScript for dynamic features such as search, filters, and user accounts.
* Consider using a simple back-end system for user authentication and class registration.

### Additional Tips:

* Use engaging visuals, such as images of instructors and the fitness studio, to enhance the website's appeal.
* Prioritize clarity and simplicity in the user interface to make it easy for clients to navigate the class schedule.
* Test the registration process thoroughly to ensure a smooth user experience.
* Provide clear calls-to-action (CTAs) for users to register or save classes.

### Timeline:

We aim to launch the website within 6 weeks. Regular updates on progress and the ability to preview the website before launch would be appreciated.
